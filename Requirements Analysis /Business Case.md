Ontario Tech University has over 11,000 students and employs around 2,500 faculty and staff. To support the facilitation of institutional data such as course schedules, deadlines, announcements, and academic analytics, the university is seeking to design an AI-Powered Digital Assistant Platform (AIDAP). The AIDAP will be used by students and faculty to receive contextual answers from AI using data from external university systems such as LMS, registration, calendars, and mail. Users can query the AIDAP in natural language and receive responses according to the user's data. To achieve this goal, the AIDAP must be integrated with these external systems using standard APIs for interoperability so the AI assistant can retrieve data for its responses. As for any system of such a scale, failures often occur. To solve such issues, the system will be deployed as a cloud-native service with continuous deployment pipelines for zero downtime and live monitoring dashboards to prevent failures. Once the system has been deployed, services can be expanded and scalability increased, with potentially more external systems the AIDAP can access for responses.
