| Quality Attribute | Description | Related Use Case and Requirements |
|---|---|---|
| Performance | A student submits a complex query and asks for the deadline of a course project while the system is under normal load (around 2000 concurrent users). The AI Core must process the query and return live data, and the contextual response must be generated within 2 seconds on average.  | R6, RS10, R5, RA7 |
| Usability | A student attempts to change notification and language preferences on the mobile app. This task must be easy to complete, even with a limited network connection. It must be intuitively clear due to an easy-to-use user interface design, allowing 90% of first-time users to complete it without requiring any additional help. | RS12, RS9, R4, RS6 |
| Availability | During peak load, when a critical database connection component fails, the AIDAP Core Service must detect the failure and automatically execute a failover. The system must complete the self-recovery process without any user noticing the interruption and ensure the 99.5% monthly availability requirement is met. | RS11, RA6, R7 |
| Modifiability | A Developer/Maintainer must be able to integrate a new, complex data connection for a Student Evaluation System by modifying the Data Integration Layer and deploy that change to production in less than five working days. | RM5, R3, RM1 |
| Interoperability | The system must successfully receive and process large, routine data updates (such as course rosters and material changes) from the LMS Data Source System using a standard API. Upon completion, it must ensure 100% data integrity and consistency across all connected systems. | RD2, R3, RD4,  RD1 |
| Security | The system must be able to immediately detect and block a brute-force login attack launched by an unauthorized external actor against administrator accounts. Even while operating under heavy usage, the system must prevent any unauthorized access to data, with the security event being logged within 500 milliseconds. | R8, RS8, RS7, RA5 |
| Maintainability | The system will implement continuous deployment pipelines to deploy updates, and live dashboards will display health, latency, and errors, enabling zero-downtime monitoring of the system. | RM1, RM2 |
